Guidance Document: Pre-market Requirements for Medical Device Cybersecurity
============================================================================


Pre-market Requirements for Medical Device Cybersecurity to medical device manufacturers regarding improvement of cybersecurity. However, it also acknowledges that it is a shared responsibility between all the stakeholders.


The guidance states that manufacturers are responsible for potential cybersecurity risks throughout the lifecycle of the product. It presents the NIST document "Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity" (2018) as best practices to guide manufacturers in cybersecurity activities.
Health Canada identifies 5 main functions within NIST:
* Identify cybersecurity risks.
* Design controls to limit risks.
* Detect when a device has been compromised due to a cybersecurity event.
* Respond to a cybersecurity event.
* Restore the device.
This guidance presents a cybersecurity strategy by secure design, risk management, and verification and validation testing. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of addressing emerging risks through patching, information sharing, post-market management and vulnerability disclosure.
Health Canada requires specific elements to assess cybersecurity for Class III and Class IV medical device license and recommends conducting cybersecurity risk management processes in parallel to the safety risk management process.
