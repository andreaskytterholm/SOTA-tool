MDCG 2019-16 *Medical Device Coordination Group: Guidance on Cybersecurity for medical devices*  
================================================================================================

Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) issued the Guidance on Cybersecurity for medical devices to help manufacturers meet the requirements of the European Union Regulations on Medical Devices and In Vitro Medical Devices. The document focuses on how to interpret what is stated in the MDR and IVDR regarding cybersecurity with specific examples.


Issuer: Medical Device Coordination Group


**The key points of this guidance are:**

* Secure design: the guidance emphasizes the importance of incorporating security features and functionalities into the design of medical devices. Manufacturers should use secure coding practices and implement security controls such as encryption and access controls.

* Security risk management throughout the device's lifecycle: manufacturers should conduct a risk assessment to identify cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate the risks.

* IT requirements: such as the GDPR, physical security and patch management.

* Documentation and instructions for use: the guidance requires manufacturers to document the cybersecurity features and functionalities of their devices.

* Post-market surveillance and vigilance: including measures for investigating and reporting cybersecurity incidents and taking appropriate corrective actions.

.. dropdown:: GL30: Security Risk Assessment

    **Description:** The manufacturer should consider the device’s intended clinical use and intended operational environment when determining the appropriate balance of safety, effectiveness and security. Threat Modelling techniques are a systematic approach for analysing the security of an item in a structural way such that vulnerabilities can be identified, enumerated, and prioritised, all from a hypothetical attacker’s point of view. Threat modelling can be applied to software, devices, systems, networks, distributed systems, business processes, etc. Threat modelling typically employs a systematic approach to identify attack vectors and assets most desired by an attacker. This leads to a decomposition of the item (software, device, system, etc.) to look at each possible attack vector and asset individually and determine to which kind of attacks they are vulnerable. From this, a list of vulnerabilities can be created and ordered in terms of risk, potential to affect safety and effectiveness, or any other criteria deemed appropriate.

Risk acceptance criteria should be established by the manufacturer and documented to guide the appropriate measures for mitigating security risks. Those criteria relate to the intended purpose and operational environment.

    * The medical device should be as autonomous as possible in terms of IT security and sole reliance on the existence of any IT security requirements on the operating environment should be kept to a minimum and reflect the manufacturer’s assumptions on the baseline environment security for the secure operation of the medical device. 
    
    * The manufacturer’s assumptions regarding the IT security of the operating environment shall be clearly documented in the instructions for use and may refer to best practice security standards. 
    
    * In accordance with the principle of layered security, IT security measures foreseen for the operating environment in general should not serve the purpose of compensating security controls for medical device vulnerabilities, unless there is sufficient justification.
