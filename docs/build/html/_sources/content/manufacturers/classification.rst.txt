Classification of medical devices
==================================

Medical devices are classified based on their intended use, complexity, and potential risk to patients and users. This classification is crucial because it determines the regulatory requirements a device must meet before it can be marketed and used in healthcare settings. 

Classification helps manufacturers understand the regulatory pathway early in the development process.
