About 
=========

The cyber compass was developed as part of the NEMECYS project as a response to the challenges first identified by the project use case partners. The challenges have further been confirmed and expanded after interactions with multiple stakeholders in Europe independent from the project through workshops and interviews. 

The NEMECYS project target three stakeholder groups that reflects the lifecycle of connected medical devices: 

	* Design time: CMD **Manufacturers**
	* Integration into connected multi-stakeholder scenarios: CMD System **Integrators**
    * In the operation of these scenarios: **Operators** (such as hospitals or care providers)
