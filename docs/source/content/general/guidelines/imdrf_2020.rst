Principles and Practices for Medical Devices
=============================================

Principles and Practices for Medical Devices. International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) have produced guidance for all stakeholders involved in the cybersecurity of medical devices including in vitro medical devices. 

This document focuses exclusively on medical device cybersecurity regarding the potential for patient harm, it does not consider other types of harm such as data privacy breaches. The document emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity as a shared responsibility among all stakeholders: medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers, users, regulators, and vulnerability finders. It encourages all stakeholders to “harmonize their approaches to cybersecurity across the entire life cycle of the medical device”.
On the one hand, the guideline gives pre-market considerations for manufacturers to address cybersecurity considerations during the design and development of a medical device prior to market entry. It gives examples referring to international standards bodies such as ISO, AAMI, IEC, NIST, OWASP and JSP.
On the other, the document also provides post-market considerations to all stakeholders including healthcare providers, patients, and manufacturers. The guideline offers a series of processes that should be applied by healthcare providers in terms of IT considerations as well as training among all users to prevent cybersecurity incidents.
Moreover, the guideline emphasizes the importance of information sharing between regulators, medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers and users. It especially encourages manufacturers to adopt coordinated vulnerability disclosure procedures.
