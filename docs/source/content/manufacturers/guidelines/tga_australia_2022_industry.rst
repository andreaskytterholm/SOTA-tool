Medical Device Cyber Security Guidance for Industry
===================================================

Medical Device Cyber Security Guidance for Industry is addressed to medical device manufacturers on how the TGA interprets regulations. In the Australian market a medical device cannot be supplied unless it is included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods where there is an established process of premarket considerations, market authorization, post market management and end-of-life.

In Australia manufacturers must demonstrate compliance with the Essential Principles, where the requirements are set out to demonstrate the minimization of the risks associated with the design, long-term safety and use of the device. A Total Product Lifecycle (TPLC) approach for risk management is required.
TGA requires that the Essential Principles are met by applying accepted best practice regarding quality management systems and risk management frameworks. The guidance provides considerations on how to address cybersecurity risks referring to the Essential Principles.
On the one hand, the document offers premarket guidance on the regulatory requirements addressing secure by design and quality by design approaches. Moreover, it presents potential strategies for risk management, the provision of information for users, and modularized design architecture. Additionally, it encourages manufacturers to implement cybersecurity assessment and penetration testing, as well as trusted access measures, and secure updating.
On the other hand, the guide offers post market guidance emphasizing the requirement for an ongoing cybersecurity risk management, and cybersecurity threat and risk response. Moreover, the document reminds manufacturers that they must demonstrate information gathering on cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
